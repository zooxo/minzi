## What is MINZI?
MINZI is based on an ATmega32 chip (delivered as arduino pro micro board).
It has got a 7 segment LED display and a keyboard with 2 keys.
Despite this low end hardware extensions MINZI is capable of some useable applications - and they become more and more ...

## Which apps does MINZI offer?
For now MINZI has got following apps:
* Passes HID-scripts to a PC (via USB) like Linux-screenshot-script, Chromebook-Crouton-startup-script, passwords)
* Sends keystrokes (as HID via USB) to a PC (i.e. PageUp and PageDown ... useful for chromebooks)
* Egg-timer with selectable start time
* Clock
* Database (select data permanently stored in the EEPROM and print it on the display or send it to a PC)
